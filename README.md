# CSharp-Wordle-Solver
A program I made in C# that can be used to solve Wordle
It works well but breaks if you give it bad input, as in giving it feedback on a word that isn't in the `wordList`

Also  substituted the actual word list with "Words here", because theres hundreds of them, but you can find the actual words on the official wordle website by digging through some scripts, shouldn't take more than 5-10 minutes
