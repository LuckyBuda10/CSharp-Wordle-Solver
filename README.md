# CSharp-Wordle-Solver
A program I made in C# that can be used to solve Wordle
It works well but breaks if you give it bad input, as in giving it feedback on a word that isn't in the `wordList`

Also  substituted the actual word list with "Words Here", because theres hundreds of them, but you can find the actual word list on the official wordle website
